Press the Play button to make the ``||loops:on start||`` **event block** run your code.

Press the light bulb icon to display an extra hint.

The shape of an event block is different from the shape of a statement block.  Event blocks hold statement blocks inside them.

```blocks
player.say("Hello, agent.")
```

```template
player.say("Your text here")
```
